A comprehensive system for monitoring, logging, and alerting on application and infrastructure metrics.

## Architecture

- Prometheus: Time-series metrics collection
- Grafana: Visualization and dashboards
- Loki: Log aggregation
- Alertmanager: Alert routing and notification
- Blackbox Exporter: External endpoint monitoring

## Goals

1. Implement the USE method (Utilization, Saturation, Errors) for infrastructure monitoring
2. Implement the RED method (Rate, Errors, Duration) for service monitoring
3. Create actionable alerts with runbooks
4. Build comprehensive dashboards for service health
